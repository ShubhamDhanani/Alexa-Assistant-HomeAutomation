# Alexa-Assistant-HomeAutomation
We made solution of this problem that is software based platform or service be created by the means of which we can control home appliances by giving voice commands. We  integrated both of the popular platforms called Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Special attention  in our solution was to integrate with our existing system for which we can build a raspberry pi  to cloud servers. That  listen to alexa/google home commands coming from the cloud/internet and forward it to our home automation devices via HTTP requests ( GET method) or socket connections and also get data from our home automation devices and push it to the cloud back.
